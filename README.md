This module provides NodeJS RESTfull APIs scaffolding based OpenAPI 3.x specs using [oas-tools](https://github.com/isa-group/oas-tools) and [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express). It is compatible with servers generated with the swagger-tool suite to help in the transition from pre-existing servers based on 2.x specs.

We have a 2 min. tutorial:

## 1\. Install oas-generator

```bash
npm install oas-generator -g
```

## 2\. Use oas-generator command

### 2.1\. Help

```bash
$ oas-generator --help

Usage:  oas-generator <OAS v3 file in YAML or JSON>

  Options:

    -n, --projectName <projectName>  Name for the generated folder
    -z, --generateZip                Indicate whether the generated folder must be deleted after compression
    -h, --help                       output usage information
```

### 2.2 Examples

Generate a NodeJS project: The following command wil create the code of a NodeJS application based on the OpenAPI Spec 3.x `docker-engine.yaml` and place its code in a folder by the name `generatedServer`.

```bash
$ oas-generator specs/docker-engine.yaml -n generatedServer
```

Once the folder is created locate into it. Install dependencies and run it by doing npm start:

```bash
$ cd generatedServer
$ npm start
```

Now your app is running on port 8080.
You can try the url [http://localhost:8080/v1.33/volumes](http://localhost:8080/v1.33/volumes)

In the folder `controllers` there will be a set of js files with the templates for each method specified in the spec that should be completed to have a fully working API.

Happy coding!
